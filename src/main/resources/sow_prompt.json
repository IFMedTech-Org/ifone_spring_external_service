The charges\nassociated with the external tests are to be paid additional according to the actuals.\n● Relevant standards will be purchased by the team and retained by the team after completion of the\nproject.\n● Ownership/IP rights: As per the mutually signed agreement.\n● Commercial related to IP: As per the mutually signed agreement.\n● Continuity and New upgrades:\n○ Changes in the component which essentially are not affecting safety and performance\nof the original device can be considered as “Minor Change” (CDSCO). This does not\nrequire approval and requires only information.\n○ Change in critical component (affecting safety and performance of the device) or\nsupplier, is considered as a “Major Change” and needs prior approval before selling the\ndevice. There are ways to mitigate this, like we will provide a list of multiple\ncomponents and a supplier list component during the final external testing then we do\nnot have to even notify. However, based on the change, “external testing” may not be\nrequired.\n○ Upgrades in the design, which does not require CDSCO approval, are also included in\nthe current scope.\n○ Upgrades in the design, which means launching Version 2.0 or further, would be\ncovered under a new transactional arrangement where CDSCO approval is required.\n● Commercials related to Manufacturing: In case IFMT is given the manufacturing contract then we will\ndo complete manufacturing support. Including sourcing of the respective parts to be done by IF\nMedtech and the respective warranty &amp; AMCs. Please note if another manufacturer is assigned then\nIFMT would still support with consultancy and advice till 2 years from the end of this project.\nHowever manufacturing process optimization post development, design changes, alternate vendor\nidentification will be on transactional engagement.\n● Documentation: IF Medtech will support in producing the future documentation which may be asked\nby regulatory bodies for product approval (both Indian and Global). {Collaborator}  will be filing for\nthe CE approval, however IF MedTech will support in responding to all technical queries &amp; related\ndocuments for CE certification. This will be covered under the current scope.\n● Target cost of the final product (BOM+Mfg) is Rs 700. Slight deviation to cost (5%-10%) can be\nassessed as per the key differentiation or some unique offering in the device. Target Cost to be\nprovided by {Collaborator} is considering 10,000 pieces per year. \" MAKE SURE YOU WRITE LIST OF  ASSUMPTIONS FOR PROJECT IN THE ABOVE STYLE.
